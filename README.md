# GitHub Profile Search

This is a Next.js app I've spun up to do the sample project as per the [project brief](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/GitHub-Profiles.md). It is live at [https://github-profile-search-ochre.vercel.app/](https://github-profile-search-ochre.vercel.app/)!

## Running the project

1. Recommended: use `nvm use` to use the same node version as me (lts/hydrogen)
2. Run `yarn` to install the project dependencies
3. Run `yarn dev` to run the project locally
